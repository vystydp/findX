/**
    You are given an array A of n integers. The elements of A are sorted in ascending order,
    and are not necessarily unique. You are also given a target integer x. Implement a
    search algorithm which finds a location j in the array such that all elements in the range
    A[0], ..., A[j - 1] are strictly less than x, and all elements in the range A[j], ..., A[n - 1]
    are greater than or equal to x. (Note that x itself need not appear in A for these
    conditions to be satisfied.) If no suitable location is found, return -1. Your solution should
    have runtime O(log n).
